    "* Equation (1) is a linear transformation of the lower layer embedding $h_i^{(l)}$\n",

    "  Here, it first concatenates the $z$ embeddings of the two nodes, where $||$\n",
    "  denotes concatenation, then takes a dot product of it and a learnable weight vector\n",
    "  $\\vec a^{(l)}$, and applies a LeakyReLU in the end. This form of attention is\n",
    "  usually called *additive attention*, contrast with the dot-product attention in the\n",
    "  Transformer model.\n",
    "* Equation (3) applies a softmax to normalize the attention scores on each node's\n",
    "  incoming edges.\n",
    "* Equation (4) is similar to GCN. The embeddings from neighbors are aggregated together,\n",
    "  scaled by the attention scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other details from the paper, such as dropout and skip connections.\n",
